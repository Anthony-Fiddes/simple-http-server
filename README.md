This is a simple HTTP server that I wrote while doing [Code Crafter's "Build Your
Own HTTP server"
challenge](https://backend.codecrafters.io/progress/http-server/911cdef7-b68f-4789-b2b9-397ccfa2363d).

From their original README:

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers,
[HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html),
and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.
